p2: Ella's favorite hobbies were described to be horseback riding, drawing/sketching, and playing the violin. Our team carefully designed the prosthetic with modularity to accept a multitude of hobby-focused attachments to give the best fit for the task given the varied interests.
p3: The art board module had some of the most care and consideration dedicated to it out of the rest. This is because Ella emphasized a passion for art and the difficulty introduced when attempting to fix the page in place and switch styles. With these challenges in mind, we designed an attachment that offers easily accessible tools and an anchor for the page to help make drawing a more enjoyable activity in Ella's life.

This project was issued to challenge our ability to overcome design obstacles and produce a functional, and carefully designed prototype for our specific client Ella.
